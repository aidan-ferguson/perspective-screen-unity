# Perspective Screen - Unity Display

This is the unity project used in partner with my [perspective screen project](https://github.com/aidan-ferguson/perspective-screen), it reads the location of a person's eyes in 3D space using a shared memory region, then draws the scene from the users perspective, calculates the homography map required to map the generated image onto the display and displays it.

A video of both programs in operation can be found in the repository linked above.
